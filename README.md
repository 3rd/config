Many things are unpolished, and there are many references to things that are not public, but you might be able to find & borrow some useful gems.

**Points of interest:**

- [Neovim setup](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3A3rd%2Fconfig%20syslang&type=code) for [Syslang](https://github.com/3rd/syslang), my custom document syntax
