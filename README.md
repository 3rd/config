# Ceci n'est pas une pipe

This repository contains a part of the plumbing that powers my workflow.
I've been iterating on it for many years.
Most of the things here are unpolished and undocumented, and there are many references to things that are not public (yet). However, you should be able to find & borrow some useful gems.

**Points of interest:**

- [Neovim configuration](home/dotfiles/nvim)
- [Emacs configuration (dead)](home/dotfiles/emacs)
- NixOS [modules](nixos/modules) and [roles](nixos/roles)
- Home Manager [modules](home/modules)
- [Scripts](home/bin)
